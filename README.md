## Prerequisites

This repository uses the Git Large File Storage (LSF) extension that needs to be installed in order to clone this repostiory.
You can find [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/) the installation instructions.

## How to Use it

If not differently stated in the specific project description, you can simply download the project files and open them with Webots.
Controllers and plugins written in C, C++ and Java have to be compiled before the first simulation run.
Please note that you should download the files from the tag/release matching your Webots major version otherwise the simulation may not work correctly.
