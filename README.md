# webots-projects

This repo contains some additional Webots projects (PROTO files, controllers, simulation worlds, etc.) officially released by Cyberbotics but not included in the Webots package.


## Projects

* NVIDIA JetBot collision avoidance with neural networks
* 

## How to Use it

If not differently stated in the specific project description, you can simply download the project files and open them with Webots.
Controllers and plugins written in C, C++ and Java have to be compiled before the first simulation run.
Please note that you should download the files from the tag/release matching your Webots major version otherwise the simulation may not work correctly.
